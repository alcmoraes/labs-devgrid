### Choices Explained

#### ReactJS with Flow

I've chosen to use ReactJS since I'm more familiar with it. Not a big deal here.
Already worked with AngularJS and it was a complete headache.

I love to use Flow since helps to prevent user errors and make the code "feels" robust IMO.

#### Bootstrap

Also chosen since I'm more familiar with it. I think its easier and faster to work since there's a lot of snippets over the internet to help with the development. In this project I've used [SBAdmin Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/).

#### Gulp / Grunt

Currently none. I'm currently using webpack.

#### NPM / Bower

I rather prefer NPM for packaging.

### Gotchas and Tips

Not that I know. :)
